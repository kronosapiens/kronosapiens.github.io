I. Introduction

Democracy is in trouble. Within the community of nations, [more and more citizens are awakening](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/19/politics-without-parties-citizens-initiatives-tax-havens-abortion-corruption-spain-mortgage-civil-society) to the realization that their ability to participate in constructive politics has been limited, and that their channels of influence have been captured by a minority of elites. Voter suppression campaigns selectively target some groups over others; gerrymandered districts virtually guarantee political stagnation. A turbo-charged media has brought the cost of influence staggeringly low, and the increasing reliance on large contributions means that leaders are ever-more attuned to the needs of the great and powerful over the general population. While we have seen the recent re-emergence of a populist "protest vote", such lines of thinking are destructive, not constructive. Pulling the emergency brake is not the same as having a say on the destination.

For some, the problem seems like an atrophying and failure of institutions. If we can refresh our institutions, throwing out the accumulated cruft and building them anew with modern tools and new knowledge, then our political chakras will be cleared. The truth is likely to be more complicated, as inevitably stumble over the question of whether people truly *want* to participate. The recent European Union elections saw a [record-high turnout](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48417744
)... of 51%. One might reason that the mere act of going to the polls is an overburden in a world of always-on work, but recent experiments in the blockchain community have revealed [similar phenomena](https://medium.com/wave-financial/blockchain-voter-apathy-69a1570e2af3); even when voting from the comfort of home, many choose to pass.

For others, the problem runs even deeper. Thinkers such as Yuval Noah Harari have begun questioning the validity of the very assumptions of democracy in an age of pervasive surveillance, powerful analysis, and cheap influence. In his 2015 [*Homo Deus*](https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/), Harari presents the argument that, if humans are merely (complex) biological algorithms, it is therefore possible *in principle* to develop machine learning algorithms which outperform them, rendering human judgment permanently irrelevant. In such a world there is no question a human could answer which a machine could not answer as well or better, the idea of people "going to the polls" would be an anachronism. In places where voting continued to exist, it would be irrelevant ritual: the people would have been influenced to vote "correctly" anyway. It is an aggressive thesis which draws a [too-straight line](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-017-0733-4) from mind to machine, but nonetheless deserves mention. In less extreme forms, it is valid to ask whether there is something beyond the romantic Rousseauean "general will", and whether there really is some irreplacable human "there" there.

Our problem, then, is at least three-fold:

1. Can people meaningfully participate?
2. Will people participate, if they have the option?
3. Do they have the capacity to participate?

This essay will develop all three themes, with emphasis on the second and third. Our central argument is that making decisions via a stream of pass/fail votes is *necessarily* tedius and alienating, and so a re-framing of decisions in terms of finances, for which outcomes are not pass/fail, makes possible more engaging and meaningful forms of participation.
