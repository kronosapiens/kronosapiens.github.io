I'm **Daniel Kronovet**, a data scientist living in New York City.

I am currently at Columbia, finishing up an M.A. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences, with an emphasis on the core math and computer science underlying modern machine learning.

I spent the past summer interning at Foursquare, joining their data science team to develop new models for stop detection.

I'm interested in the future of machine learning, especially as it pertains to questions of production, distribution, and management. I am interested in more abstract questions of measurement and representation. I believe in the importance of direct personal experience as a path toward knowledge.

In past lives, I worked on a kibbutz in Israel, lived in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, and taught science in Mumbai.

I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, as a double major in Cognitive Science and Political Economy. While there, I was actively involved in the leadership of the Berkeley Student Cooperative.

I grew up in Santa Monica, California, where I was on my high school's drumline and became an Eagle Scout.
