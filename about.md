I'm **Daniel Kronovet**, a data scientist living in Tel Aviv. I work at [Colony.io](https://colony.io/) as a research engineer, writing the smart contracts powering their future-of-work platform. I was part of the team which developed [BudgetBox](https://colony.io/budgetbox.pdf), a mechanism for decentralized capital allocation. I am also the creator of [Talmud.ai](https://talmud.ai/), an interactive art project and identity game. I was most recently at Foursquare, on the [Pilgrim](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/developers/pilgrim) team, helping to improve the quality of their location intelligence.

I graduated from Columbia, with an M.A. in [QMSS](http://www.qmss.columbia.edu/), emphasizing the core math and computer science underlying modern machine learning. You can read my (fun) thesis [here](/thesis.pdf).

I am interested in the future of technology, as it pertains to questions of production, distribution, and management. I am also interested in more abstract questions of representation and measurement.

In past lives, I worked on a kibbutz in Israel, lived in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, and sat on the boards of multiple non-profits.

I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, as a double major in Cognitive Science and Political Economy. While there, I was actively involved in the leadership of the [Berkeley Student Cooperative](https://www.bsc.coop/).

I grew up in Santa Monica, where I played on my high school drumline and became an Eagle Scout.
