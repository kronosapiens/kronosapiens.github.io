**Kronosapiens Labs** is a technology company, specializing in governance innovation.

We are interested in the future of technology as it relates to resource management and social choice, as well as in more abstract questions of representation and measurement. We draw influence from game design, economics, cybernetics, information theory, and political philosophy.

Our thesis is that through the development of more intuitive and game-like interfaces, sophisticated governance capabilities can be made more accessible.

Our most notable in-house project is [Chore Wheel](https://zaratan.world/chorewheel), a suite of governance tools for coliving. This project is under active development and has received grant funding from [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) and [Metagov](https://metagov.org/), and has been the subject of [published research](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4856267).

Our main client is Collectively Intelligent, Ltd., where we contribute to the design and implementation of [Colony](https://colony.io/), their future-of-work platform. We specifically led the development of [Budget Box]({{site.baseurl}}/papers/budgetbox.pdf), a public goods funding mechanism, and [Coin Machine](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-coin-machine/), a mechanism for fair and fun token sales.

We are enthusiastic, creative, and resourceful. Please [reach out](mailto:kronovet@gmail.com) about projects or collaborations.
