Hi! I'm **Daniel Kronovet**, a data scientist living in Tel Aviv. I work at [Colony](https://colony.io/) as a research engineer, contributing to the design and implementation of their future-of-work platform. I led the development of [Budget Box](https://colony.io/budgetbox.pdf), a mechanism for decentralized capital allocation. I was most recently at Foursquare, on the [Pilgrim](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/developers/pilgrim) machine learning team, developing algorithms for modeling noisy location data.

I graduated from Columbia, with an M.A. in [QMSS](http://www.qmss.columbia.edu/), emphasizing the core math and computer science underlying modern machine learning. You can read my (fun) thesis [here](/thesis.pdf).

I am interested in the future of technology as it pertains to questions of resource management and social choice, as well as in more abstract questions of representation and measurement. In particular, I am very interested in ways in which digital artifacts may be imbued with "legitimacy", as subjectively judged by the people interacting with them.

In past lives, I have worked on a kibbutz in Israel, lived in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, and served on the boards of multiple non-profits.

I completed my B.A. at UC Berkeley, as a double major in Cognitive Science and Political Economy. While there, I was [actively involved](https://youtu.be/--B0uBXskZ0) in the leadership of the [Berkeley Student Cooperative](https://www.bsc.coop/).

I grew up in Santa Monica, where I played on my high school drumline and became an Eagle Scout.
