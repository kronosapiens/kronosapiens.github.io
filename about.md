**Kronosapiens Labs** is a technology consultancy.

We are interested in the future of technology as it pertains to questions of resource management and social choice, as well as in more abstract questions of representation and measurement. We draw influence from game design, economics, cybernetics, and political philosophy.

Our most significant in-house project is [ChoreWheel](https://zaratan.world/), a set of pioneering tools for coliving, under active development.

Our main client is [Colony](https://colony.io/), where we contribute to the design and implementation of their future-of-work platform. We specifically led the development of [Budget Box](https://colony.io/budgetbox.pdf), a mechanism for decentralized capital allocation, and [Coin Machine](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-coin-machine/), a mechanism for fair and fun token sales.

We are **enthusiastic, creative, and resourceful**. Please [reach out](mailto:kronovet@gmail.com) with potential projects or collaborations.

**About Daniel**

Before Kronosapiens Labs, Daniel worked at Foursquare, on the [Pilgrim](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/developers/pilgrim) machine learning team, developing algorithms for modeling noisy location data.

He graduated from Columbia, with an M.A. in [QMSS](http://www.qmss.columbia.edu/), emphasizing the core math and computer science underlying modern machine learning. You can read his thesis [here](/thesis.pdf).

Before starting his career in technology, Daniel worked on a kibbutz in Israel, lived in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, and served on the boards of multiple non-profits. At various points, he lived in Los Angeles, Berkeley, New York, and Tel Aviv.

He completed his B.A. at UC Berkeley, as a double major in Cognitive Science and Political Economy. While there, he was [actively involved](https://youtu.be/--B0uBXskZ0) in the leadership of the [Berkeley Student Cooperative](https://www.bsc.coop/).

He grew up in Santa Monica, California, where he played on his high school drumline and became an Eagle Scout.
