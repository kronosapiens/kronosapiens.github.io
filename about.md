**Kronosapiens Labs** is a technology company specializing in governance innovation.

We are interested in the future of technology as it relates to resource management and social choice, drawing influence from game design, economics, cybernetics, information theory, and political economy.
We believe that through the development of intuitive and game-like interfaces, sophisticated governance capabilities can be made broadly accessible.

Our main client is the [Cartridge Gaming Company](https://cartridge.gg/), where we lead developer relations for [Dojo](https://dojoengine.org/), their Cairo-based game engine.
Previously, we spent several years as a core contributor to [Colony](https://colony.io/), the future-of-work platform, where we led the development of the [Budget Box]({{site.baseurl}}/papers/budgetbox.pdf) and [Coin Machine](https://blog.colony.io/introducing-coin-machine/) algorithms.
Our most notable in-house project is [Chore Wheel](https://zaratan.world/chorewheel), a suite of collaboration tools for coliving. This project is under active development and has received grant funding from [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) and [Metagov](https://metagov.org/).


We are enthusiastic, creative, and resourceful. Please [reach out](mailto:kronovet@gmail.com) about projects or collaborations.
