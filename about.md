I'm **Daniel Kronovet**, a data scientist living in New York City. I work at Foursquare, on the [Pilgrim](https://enterprise.foursquare.com/developers/pilgrim) team, helping to improve the quality of their location intelligence.

I recently graduated from Columbia, with an M.A. in [QMSS](http://www.qmss.columbia.edu/), emphasizing the core math and computer science underlying modern machine learning. You can read my thesis [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kronosapiens/thesis/blob/master/tex/thesis.pdf).

I am interested in the future of technology, as it pertains to questions of production, distribution, and management. I am also interested in more abstract questions of representation and measurement.

In past lives, I worked on a kibbutz in Israel, lived in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, and taught science in Mumbai.

I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, as a double major in Cognitive Science and Political Economy. While there, I was actively involved in the leadership of the [Berkeley Student Cooperative](https://www.bsc.coop/).

I grew up in Santa Monica, where I played on my high school drumline and became an Eagle Scout.
