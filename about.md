  I'm Daniel Kronovet, a first-year data scientist living in New York City.
  Abacus is my technical blog, where I write about software, information,
  and my experiences navigating professional life.

  I keep a personal blog
  over at [kronosapiens.com](kronosapiens.com) where I dwell on a broader
  range of topics.
