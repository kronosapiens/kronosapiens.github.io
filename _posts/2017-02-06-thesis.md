I am very happy to announce that I have completed a thesis.
Titled "An Analysis of Pairwise Preference", it describes a theory of decision-making which allows for the formal analysis of subjective preferences.
As an academic work, it is an exercise in developing a theory from first principles, demonstrating a grasp of method and rigor.

The thesis consists of data, code, and tex. You can find the [thesis repository](https://github.com/kronosapiens/thesis) on GitHub, and the text [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kronosapiens/thesis/blob/master/tex/thesis.pdf).

All code is free for reuse. Any feedback would be welcome!
