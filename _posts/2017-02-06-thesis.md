I am very happy to announce that I have completed a master's thesis. Titled "An Analysis of Pairwise Preference", it describes a theory of decision-making which allows for the formal analysis of subjective preferences. As an academic work, it is an exercise in developing a theory from first principles, demonstrating a grasp of method and rigor. The experience of writing it was excellent.

The thesis consists of [data](https://github.com/kronosapiens/thesis/tree/master/data), [code](https://github.com/kronosapiens/thesis/tree/master/code), and [tex](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kronosapiens/thesis/blob/master/tex/thesis.pdf). Feedback welcome.
